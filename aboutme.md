I work at an insurance company in the Netherlands as an actuarial analyst and have a background in mathematics, physics and astronomy. My main focus during my daily work involves the pricing of our various insurance products. Besides some specialized pricing software we use Python to prepare and analyse the data we use. This partly explains my interest in Python, but to be honest I have been interested in programming since university (which is quite some time ago, sadly) and love exploring things in my spare time.

I have worked with a lot of programming languages (C, Pascal, Visual Basic, Objective C, Swift), but the last couple of years I have mainly focussed on Python as my programming language of choice to get things done quickly and efficiently. Recently I've also become interested in the Julia programming language, but I still have to find the time to explore this in more detail. Summarizing: I love programming and hope to be able to post regularly on this blog.

Other interests: science in general, gaming (Playstation 3 / 4, I love the Uncharted games), reading (good) science fiction (books from Peter F. Hamilton, Robert A. Heinlein, James Patrick Hogan for example), running (mainly 5K's, no marathons or something like that...), a wide range of music with favorites like [Marillion](www.marillion.com), [Riverside](https://riversideband.pl/en/), [Heather Nova](https://www.heathernova.com) and [Eels](http://www.eelstheband.com). Summarizing: days are just way too short...
